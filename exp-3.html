            Inline styling in HTML is when you apply CSS styles directly to individual elements using the style attribute. It's helpful for quick or one-time changes but can make the code messy if overused. External styling involves writing all the CSS rules in a separate file and linking it to the HTML page. This method keeps the structure and design separate, making it easier to manage and update styles across multiple pages.
